# CP1404 Practical 02 – Reflection

## Lecture videos watched so far
- Watched: **60%**

## My schedule for lectures
- **When:** most of the time I watch lecture videos at night.
- **Where:** in my home 
- **Duration each session:** 30mins - 1 hour

## What I’m doing well (keep doing)
- Following the standard program structure (main + small functions).
- Pushing at the end of each task so GitHub is always up to date.

## What I need to stop or change (overall)
- - Stop leaving files empty on GitHub—write code locally, then commit & push.

## Practicals – what I’ll improve
- Start each file with pseudocode.
- Run the linter/formatter before pushing.

## Practicals – what I’m doing well
- ...Using constants instead of magic numbers (e.g., MIN_SCORE, MAX_SCORE).
- ...Writing short, descriptive docstrings and verb-phrase function names.

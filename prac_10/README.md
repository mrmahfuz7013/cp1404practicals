## Estimates

### Regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks...

#### How was your estimate accuracy usually?
At the beginning of the subject, my estimates were often inaccurate. I regularly underestimated how long tasks
would take, especially when a prac involved debugging, learning a new concept (like classes, Kivy, or Flask), 
or working across multiple files. I often assumed the “simple” parts would only take a few minutes, but once
I started coding, small details, bugs and misunderstandings made them take much longer.

#### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?
My estimate accuracy improved as I completed more pracs. I started breaking each prac into smaller tasks
(for example: “read instructions”, “design functions”, “write code”, “test and fix bugs”) and estimated each 
part separately instead of guessing one big number. Over time, my estimates became much closer to the actual 
time spent, especially for the later pracs and assignments where I had a better feel for my own working speed.

#### What did you learn from doing these estimates?
I learned that estimating is a real skill, not random guessing. It forces me to think about the complexity of 
a task before I start and to allow extra time for things going wrong. I also learned that keeping a rough 
record of planned vs. actual time helps me improve my planning and avoid last-minute panic. Overall, the
estimating habit made me more organised and realistic about how long programming work takes.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?
From being reviewed, I learned that other people can see problems and improvements that I miss in my own code.
Reviewers pointed out issues like unclear variable names, duplicated code, missing constants, weak docstrings,
and places where I could separate logic into smaller functions. Their feedback helped me align my work more 
closely with the CP1404 programming patterns and style guide, and it showed me that code readability is just as
important as “making it work”.

## Practicals

### Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?


### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?
I did well at improving my code quality over the semester. As the pracs progressed, I became much more consistent at 
using constants, following SRP, writing clear function names, avoiding repeated code, and keeping input/output separate
from logic. I also kept my repos tidy, committed regularly with meaningful messages, and used GitHub properly for code 
reviews. Overall, I completed the pracs thoroughly and treated them as preparation for the assignments, not just boxes
to tick.

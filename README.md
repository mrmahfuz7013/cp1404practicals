# CP1404 Practicals – Mahfuzur Rahman

## About This Repository
This repository contains all of my CP1404 practical work for Programming II.  
Each practical demonstrates programming concepts such as functions, classes, file reading, data processing, and clean coding practices.  
I am Mahfuzur Rahman, a JCU student completing CP1404 and learning how to write clean, consistent, and maintainable Python code.

## Key Lessons Learned About Clean Code
- Use small, single-responsibility functions to keep logic clear and easy to maintain.
- Follow naming conventions, avoid magic numbers by using constants, and write readable, consistent code.
- Apply the DRY principle to remove duplication and improve overall program structure and reliability.

# CP1404 Practical Reflection

### What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?
In this subject, I’ve started coding more systematically by following the structure taught in lectures — using functions, classes, and proper naming conventions.  
I now plan my code before writing it, following the Single Responsibility Principle and keeping each function focused.  
I’ve also become more confident with using Git and GitHub for version control, especially creating branches like `prac_06_feedback` and using pull requests for peer review.

### What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?
I still need to improve my consistency with testing and reviewing my code before submission.  
Sometimes I only test the main parts instead of checking all edge cases.  
I also need to spend more time reading through the practical instructions slowly to make sure I understand every step before starting.  
In future, I’ll try to finish each practical earlier in the week so I have time to review and reflect properly.

### What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?
I’m doing well at writing clean, readable code that follows the JCU Style Guide and Programming Patterns.  
I’ve been applying good practices such as avoiding global variables, using constants, and including docstrings in imperative mood.  
I’m also using GitHub effectively by committing regularly with clear commit messages and collaborating through code reviews.

### What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?
I need to stop relying too much on example solutions before trying to solve problems myself.  
I want to focus more on problem-solving and debugging my own errors to develop stronger independent coding skills.  
I also plan to improve my time management by setting small weekly goals for each practical.

### What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?
I think it would be helpful to have more real-world examples that connect the practicals to how coding is used in industry.  
Seeing how these concepts apply to real projects would make learning more interesting and meaningful.
